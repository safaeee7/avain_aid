    gr_intro1: "Biosecurity is the most effective way to prevent poultry diseases — often more powerful than vaccines or medication. It’s not just for large farms; every backyard keeper, student, and commercial farmer can stop disease before it starts.",
    gr_intro2: "These 5 Golden Rules are based on global best practices from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and national veterinary guidelines — including Morocco’s animal health protocols.",
    gr_intro3: "Follow them consistently to protect your birds, your livelihood, and public health.",
    gr_rule: "Golden Rule",
    gr_whyTitle: "Why It Matters",
    gr_practicesTitle: "✅ Best Practices",
    gr_insightTitle: "🧪 Scientific Insight",
    gr_rule1_title: "Limit Access – Control Who and What Enters Your Flock",
    gr_rule1_why: "Over 70% of disease outbreaks in poultry are linked to human movement, vehicles, or contaminated equipment (FAO, 2022). You can carry viruses like Avian Influenza or Newcastle Disease on your boots, clothes, or hands — even if you don’t feel sick.",
    gr_rule1_practice1: "Restrict visitors to essential personnel only.",
    gr_rule1_practice2: "Install signage: “Authorized Personnel Only – Biosecurity Zone”.",
    gr_rule1_practice3: "Provide dedicated footwear and coveralls for anyone entering the coop.",
    gr_rule1_practice4: "Avoid visiting other poultry farms before coming to your birds (or do so only after a 48-hour break).",
    gr_rule1_insight: "A study in Morocco found that farms allowing frequent visitors had 3.5 times higher risk of Newcastle Disease outbreaks (El Allali et al., Veterinary Medicine and Science, 2021).",
    gr_rule1_quote: "People are the most common vector of disease transmission in smallholder systems.",
    gr_rule1_quoteAuthor: "FAO, Biosecurity for Small-Scale Poultry Keepers, 2023",
    gr_rule2_title: "Clean & Disinfect – Break the Chain of Infection",
    gr_rule2_why: "Pathogens like Salmonella, E. coli, and Avian Influenza virus can survive for days to weeks on surfaces, tools, and footwear. Regular cleaning removes organic matter; disinfection kills the germs.",
    gr_rule2_practice1: "Clean before disinfecting: Remove manure, feed, and litter first.",
    gr_rule2_practice2: "Use effective disinfectants like Virkon S, Bleach (1:200 dilution), or Calcium hydroxide (lime).",
    gr_rule2_practice3: "Change footbath solution daily — it becomes ineffective when dirty.",
    gr_rule2_practice4: "Disinfect equipment weekly (feeders, waterers, crates).",
    gr_rule2_insight: "A WOAH report confirms that Virkon S inactivates HPAI (H5N1) within 10 minutes at recommended concentrations (WOAH, 2023). Bleach is effective but less stable in sunlight and organic debris.",
    gr_rule2_quote: "Disinfection must follow thorough cleaning. Organic matter (e.g., manure) neutralizes most disinfectants.",
    gr_rule2_quoteAuthor: "USDA, Biosecurity for Poultry, 2022",
    gr_rule3_title: "Isolate New or Sick Birds – Prevent Silent Spread",
    gr_rule3_why: "Birds can carry diseases like Mycoplasma gallisepticum or Salmonella Pullorum without showing symptoms. Introducing them directly to your flock risks a silent outbreak.",
    gr_rule3_practice1: "Quarantine all new birds for at least 30 days in a separate enclosure (minimum 10 meters away).",
    gr_rule3_practice2: "Use dedicated tools, clothing, and gloves for the quarantine area.",
    gr_rule3_practice3: "Observe daily for coughing, diarrhea, or lethargy.",
    gr_rule3_practice4: "Only introduce after a full quarantine period with no signs of illness.",
    gr_rule3_insight: "The FAO recommends 30-day quarantine as the minimum to detect latent infections (FAO, Poultry Biosecurity Guidelines, 2021). In commercial systems, PCR testing at day 7 and day 28 is advised.",
    gr_rule3_quote: "Quarantine is the single most effective measure to prevent introduction of new pathogens.",
    gr_rule3_quoteAuthor: "OIE (now WOAH), Terrestrial Animal Health Code",
    gr_rule4_title: "Stop Wild Bird & Pest Traffic – Close the Back Door",
    gr_rule4_why: "Wild birds (especially waterfowl) are natural reservoirs of Avian Influenza. Rodents, flies, and ticks can carry Salmonella, Pasteurella, and Borrelia anserina.",
    gr_rule4_practice1: "Cover outdoor runs with netting to prevent wild bird access.",
    gr_rule4_practice2: "Store feed in sealed containers to avoid attracting rodents.",
    gr_rule4_practice3: "Remove standing water and clean up spilled feed daily.",
    gr_rule4_practice4: "Seal coop cracks to prevent rodent entry.",
    gr_rule4_insight: "A study in North Africa linked HPAI outbreaks to proximity to wetlands and migratory bird routes (Benbouzid et al., Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 2020). Rodents can carry Salmonella for up to 6 months.",
    gr_rule4_quote: "Biosecurity must include vector control. A fly can carry millions of bacteria on its body.",
    gr_rule4_quoteAuthor: "FAO, Integrated Pest Management in Poultry, 2022",
    gr_rule5_title: "Know the Signs – Early Detection Saves Lives",
    gr_rule5_why: "Many diseases (e.g., Newcastle, IBD, Coccidiosis) spread rapidly. Daily observation allows early intervention — reducing mortality and preventing farm-wide outbreaks.",
    gr_rule5_practice1: "Observe your flock daily for respiratory signs, diarrhea, lethargy, or drops in egg production.",
    gr_rule5_practice2: "Keep a flock health log (date, symptoms, actions taken).",
    gr_rule5_practice3: "Act immediately if you see signs of notifiable diseases (e.g., HPAI, ND).",
    gr_rule5_practice4: "Report suspected cases to local veterinary authorities.",
    gr_rule5_insight: "Early detection of Newcastle Disease can reduce mortality from 90% to under 30% through isolation and supportive care (WOAH, 2023). Farmers who keep logs detect illness 2–3 days earlier on average (USDA APHIS, 2021).",

Elle n'est pas réservée aux grandes exploitations ; chaque éleveur amateur, étudiant et agriculteur commercial peut arrêter la maladie avant qu'elle ne commence.",
    gr_intro2: "Ces 5 Règles d'Or sont basées sur les meilleures pratiques mondiales de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé Animale (OMSA), de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO), et des directives vétérinaires nationales — y compris les protocoles de santé animale du Maroc.",

    gr_rule1_title: "Limiter l'Accès – Contrôler Qui et Quoi Entre dans Votre Élevage",
    gr_rule1_why: "Plus de 70% des épidémies de maladies aviaires sont liées aux déplacements humains, aux véhicules ou au matériel contaminé (FAO, 2022). Vous pouvez transporter des virus comme l'Influenza Aviaire ou la Maladie de Newcastle sur vos bottes, vos vêtements ou vos mains — même si vous ne vous sentez pas malade.",
    gr_rule1_practice1: "Restreindre les visiteurs au personnel essentiel uniquement.",

    gr_rule1_practice4: "Éviter de visiter d'autres fermes avicoles avant de vous rendre auprès de vos oiseaux (ou ne le faire qu'après une pause de 48 heures).",
    gr_rule1_insight: "Une étude au Maroc a révélé que les fermes autorisant des visiteurs fréquents avaient un risque 3,5 fois plus élevé d'épidémies de Maladie de Newcastle (El Allali et al., Veterinary Medicine and Science, 2021).",

    gr_rule2_title: "Nettoyer & Désinfecter – Briser la Chaîne de l'Infection",
    gr_rule2_why: "Des agents pathogènes comme Salmonella, E. coli et le virus de l'Influenza Aviaire peuvent survivre de plusieurs jours à plusieurs semaines sur les surfaces, les outils et les chaussures. Le nettoyage régulier élimine la matière organique ; la désinfection tue les germes.",
    gr_rule2_practice1: "Nettoyer avant de désinfecter : enlever d'abord le fumier, les aliments et la litière.",
    gr_rule2_practice2: "Utiliser des désinfectants efficaces comme le Virkon S, l'eau de Javel (dilution 1:200) ou l'hydroxyde de calcium (chaux).",
    gr_rule2_practice3: "Changer la solution du pédiluve quotidiennement — elle devient inefficace lorsqu'elle est sale.",
    gr_rule2_practice4: "Désinfecter le matériel chaque semaine (mangeoires, abreuvoirs, caisses).",
    gr_rule2_insight: "Un rapport de l'OMSA confirme que le Virkon S inactive l'IAHP (H5N1) en 10 minutes aux concentrations recommandées (OMSA, 2023). L'eau de Javel est efficace mais moins stable à la lumière du soleil et en présence de débris organiques.",
    gr_rule2_quote: "La désinfection doit suivre un nettoyage approfondi. La matière organique (par ex. le fumier) neutralise la plupart des désinfectants.",

    gr_rule3_title: "Isoler les Oiseaux Nouveaux ou Malades – Prévenir la Propagation Silencieuse",
    gr_rule3_why: "Les oiseaux peuvent être porteurs de maladies comme Mycoplasma gallisepticum ou Salmonella Pullorum sans montrer de symptômes. Les introduire directement dans votre élevage risque de provoquer une épidémie silencieuse.",
    gr_rule3_practice1: "Mettre en quarantaine tous les nouveaux oiseaux pendant au moins 30 jours dans un enclos séparé (à 10 mètres minimum).",
    gr_rule3_practice2: "Utiliser des outils, des vêtements et des gants dédiés pour la zone de quarantaine.",

    gr_rule3_practice4: "N'introduire qu'après une période de quarantaine complète sans aucun signe de maladie.",
    gr_rule3_insight: "La FAO recommande une quarantaine de 30 jours comme minimum pour détecter les infections latentes (FAO, Lignes directrices sur la biosécurité avicole, 2021). Dans les systèmes commerciaux, des tests PCR au jour 7 et au jour 28 sont conseillés.",

    gr_rule4_title: "Arrêter le Trafic d'Oiseaux Sauvages & de Nuisibles – Fermer la Porte Arrière",
    gr_rule4_why: "Les oiseaux sauvages (surtout les oiseaux d'eau) sont des réservoirs naturels de l'Influenza Aviaire. Les rongeurs, les mouches et les tiques peuvent transporter Salmonella, Pasteurella et Borrelia anserina.",
    gr_rule4_practice1: "Couvrir les parcours extérieurs avec un filet pour empêcher l'accès des oiseaux sauvages.",

    gr_rule4_insight: "Une étude en Afrique du Nord a lié les épidémies d'IAHP à la proximité des zones humides et des routes migratoires des oiseaux (Benbouzid et al., Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 2020). Les rongeurs peuvent être porteurs de Salmonella jusqu'à 6 mois.",

    gr_rule5_title: "Connaître les Signes – la Détection Précoce Sauve des Vies",
    gr_rule5_why: "De nombreuses maladies (par ex. Newcastle, IBD, Coccidiose) se propagent rapidement. L'observation quotidienne permet une intervention précoce — réduisant la mortalité et prévenant les épidémies à l'échelle de la ferme.",
    gr_rule5_practice1: "Observer votre élevage quotidiennement pour déceler des signes respiratoires, de la diarrhée, de la léthargie ou une baisse de la production d'œufs.",
